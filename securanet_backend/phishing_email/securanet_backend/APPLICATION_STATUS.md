# SecuraNet Application Status Report

## üîç Model Testing Results

### Model Evaluation Summary
- **Model Type**: Rule-based classifier with feature importance weighting
- **Training Data**: Email headers dataset (8.3MB)
- **Features**: 32 features including header structure and suspicious keywords
- **Current Threshold**: 0.5

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 37.5% (3/8 test cases correct)
- **Precision**: 37.5% (high false positive rate)
- **Recall**: 100% (catches all phishing emails)
- **F1-Score**: 54.5%

### Model Issues Identified
1. **High False Positive Rate**: Model is too sensitive, classifying legitimate emails as phishing
2. **Low Precision**: Many legitimate emails are flagged as suspicious
3. **Threshold Too Low**: Current threshold of 0.5 may need adjustment

### Model Strengths
1. **Perfect Recall**: Successfully identifies all phishing attempts
2. **Feature Diversity**: Uses multiple feature types (structural, keyword-based)
3. **Fast Classification**: Rule-based approach provides quick results

## üöÄ Application Deployment Status

### Backend (Django)
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Running on http://localhost:8000
- ‚úÖ **Model**: Loaded and functional
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: Available for header analysis
- ‚úÖ **Database**: SQLite database initialized

### Frontend (React)
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Installed and configured
- ‚úÖ **UI**: Modern Bootstrap-based interface

## üìä Model Testing Results

### Test Cases Evaluated
1. **Legitimate Business Email**: ‚ùå Misclassified as phishing
2. **Legitimate Order Confirmation**: ‚ùå Misclassified as phishing  
3. **Legitimate Service Notification**: ‚ùå Misclassified as phishing
4. **Phishing with Urgent Keywords**: ‚úÖ Correctly identified
5. **Phishing with Payment Keywords**: ‚úÖ Correctly identified
6. **Phishing with Password Reset**: ‚úÖ Correctly identified
7. **Legitimate Security Alert**: ‚ùå Misclassified as phishing
8. **Legitimate Billing Notification**: ‚ùå Misclassified as phishing

### Top Features by Importance
1. `length`: 1.000 (header length)
2. `has_subject`: 0.208 (subject line presence)
3. `has_click`: 0.051 (suspicious keyword)
4. `has_account`: 0.028 (suspicious keyword)
5. `has_limited`: 0.023 (suspicious keyword)

## üîß Recommendations for Model Improvement

### Immediate Actions
1. **Adjust Threshold**: Increase from 0.5 to 1.0-1.5 to reduce false positives
2. **Add Legitimate Keywords**: Include business terms that indicate legitimate emails
3. **Feature Engineering**: Add domain reputation and sender verification features

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Retrain with Better Data**: Use more diverse legitimate email samples
2. **Implement ML Models**: Consider Random Forest or SVM for better performance
3. **Add Context Features**: Include email body analysis and link checking
4. **Real-time Learning**: Implement feedback mechanism for continuous improvement

## üéØ Application Usage

### How to Use the Application
1. **Access Frontend**: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. **Input Email Header**: Paste email header text in the analysis form
3. **Get Results**: View comprehensive analysis including:
   - Phishing detection result
   - Risk score and level
   - DNS security checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - IP geolocation information
   - Detailed breakdown of suspicious elements

### API Endpoints Available
- `POST /analyze-header/`: Main analysis endpoint
- `GET /api/health/`: Health check endpoint
- `GET /admin/`: Django admin interface

## ‚úÖ Current Status: APPLICATION RUNNING

Both backend and frontend servers are running successfully. The model is functional but could benefit from the recommended improvements to reduce false positives.

### Next Steps
1. Test the application with real email headers
2. Monitor false positive/negative rates
3. Implement threshold adjustment based on usage patterns
4. Consider retraining with additional legitimate email samples
